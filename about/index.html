Hi, I&rsquo;m Nick Ebbitt, a software engineer currently working for Morgan Stanley.
Software development is my passion, particularly the processes involved in delivering change. The ability to regularly deliver value in a controlled, automated fashion is central to the way I work. I&rsquo;m a dev at heart with a strong interest in ops.
I love writing code with core strengths in Java but experience of a variety of others such as NodeJS, Go and Python. I enjoy working with Kubernetes based platforms and know my way around Istio service mesh.
