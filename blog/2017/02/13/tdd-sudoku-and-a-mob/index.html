The inspiration for this session was provided by a similar exercise carried out by <a href=http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/oksudoku/>Ron Jeffries around 10 years ago</a>. The objective was to follow a similar process to create a &ldquo;Sudoku Solver&rdquo; with the aim of understanding the possible reasons why Ron&rsquo;s attempt was ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve never played <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku>Sudoku</a> and have only read about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>Test-driven Development (TDD)</a> via various sources as well as being half way through the <a href=http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/>GOOS</a> book. I was keen to learn more about TTD and this looked like a good opportunity to.</p><p>What I hadn&rsquo;t realised was that we would be using the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming>mob programming</a> format with an element of rotation to allow all attendees (around 20 or so) to get involved. I was already aware of mob programming following <a href=https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill>Woody Zuill&rsquo;s</a> great talk at the Coop last year so was interested to experience this also.</p><p>So this was set to be a great chance to learn about, and practice, some new skills.</p><p>So what did I learn?</p><p>Sudoku looks like a fun little game, not sure why I&rsquo;ve never bothered to play properly it but aim to sometime soon.</p><p>TDD is conceptually straight forward but put 15+ people working on a problem together and various styles and opinions create an interesting dynamic. I didn&rsquo;t really learn anything new about TDD. Like most things people have their preferred ways of approaching a problem and this was evident as we initially struggled to gain any momentum due to conflicting views.</p><p>A mob of 15+ programmers with varying opinions, some on less important factors such as coding style, can easily result in a less than productive overall process. The large number will no doubt be a factor here but possibly someone controlling the mob and providing more direction to keep focus on the problem at hand would be beneficial. We did waste a lot of time on &ldquo;tabs vs spaces&rdquo; type discussion.</p><p>So while the first session wasn&rsquo;t hugely productive in terms of creating a &ldquo;Sudoku Solver&rdquo; it was definitely an interesting process. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next session where we&rsquo;ll look to progress further with hopefully more discipline.</p><p>Finally, I just stumbled on <a href=https://silkandspinach.net/2017/02/10/its-bikesheds-all-the-way-down/>a post</a> from Kevin Rutherford who was also in attendance. Some useful additional insights.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2017/03/22/asynchronous-web-service-using-completable-future/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
