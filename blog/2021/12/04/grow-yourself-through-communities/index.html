It was in the form of an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)>Ignite talk</a> which was great fun but I realised that there were a few slides that felt a little lightweight compared to others.</p><p>Writing the talk up as a blog post will hopefully help me to fill out the lighter parts, as well as maybe make it suitable for a longer length talk at some point in the future.</p><p>It may even prove useful for those out there who weren&rsquo;t able to see the talk or prefer the written form.</p><hr><p><img src=what.png alt=what></p><p>There are a few definitions of what a community is but for the purposes of this talk the one that resonates with me most is this&mldr;</p><blockquote><p>the condition of sharing or having certain attitudes and interests in common.</p></blockquote><p>The word community has evolved from the word common and this is key.</p><p>The idea of a community is that the people involved in it have something in common, whether that&rsquo;s beliefs, ideas, attitudes or interests.</p><p><img src=why.png alt=why></p><p>Communities are important to us as people as they give us a sense of belonging.</p><p>Finding other people with things in common to us is part of human nature.</p><p>Communities help us to meet and connect with others who share our interests and provide a safe space for us to grow.</p><p>There are many different kinds of communities exist so here are a few that relate most closely to my experiences working in tech.</p><p><img src=family.png alt=family></p><p>For me, the most important community is the one at home.</p><p>My family are the foundations of what make it possible for me to be a success in both my personal life and at work.
They provide support and a basic sense of security that give me the space to grow and succeed.</p><p>When you do fail, which will happen from time to time, I can always rely on them to pick me up and give me the motivation to go again.</p><p><img src=team.png alt=team></p><p>In a professional context, the first community that comes to mind is your team.</p><p>These are the people who you work with day-to-day and share the same business priorities with.
You&rsquo;ll often have aligned ideas and principles about how you believe work should be done.</p><p>You will also disagree on things and that&rsquo;s ok.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll collaborate with your team in various ways through things like coaching and pairing, or even socialising outside of work.</p><p><img src=organisation.png alt=organisation></p><p>If you look wider than your immediate team within your organisation there are usually multiple communities that are active at any one time.</p><p>Some examples are guilds focused on things like sustainability and LGBT+.</p><p>Other examples are groups focused on personal development & knowledge sharing such as an early careers network or a tech talk community.</p><p><img src=local-tech.png alt=local-tech></p><p>Outside of the place where you work your next step may be to look at the local tech community.</p><p>These are often focused on a specific technology, some key examples for me being <a href=https://dev.java/community/jugs/>Java User Groups (JUGs)</a> such as the <a href=https://www.meetup.com/ManchesterUK-Java-Community/>Manchester Java Community</a> and the <a href=https://londonjavacommunity.co.uk/>London Java Community</a>.</p><p>Some other key communities that I&rsquo;ve found hugely beneficial are those that focus around how we deliver software such as <a href=https://twitter.com/xpmanchester>XP Manchester</a>.</p><p><img src=wider-tech.png alt=wider-tech></p><p>Taking this a step wider we can start to look at the wider tech community.</p><p>This could be based around an open source project.
An example I&rsquo;ve become involved in over the last few years is the <a href=https://adoptium.net/>Adoptium</a> project that provides Java binaries to millions of developers and organisations worldwide.</p><p>Then there are conferences such as <a href=https://www.devoxx.co.uk/>Devoxx UK</a> who provide an excellent community focused Java conference.</p><p>Finally, if you&rsquo;ve never experienced one, I highly recommend seeking out and attending an unconference.
The best example I&rsquo;ve found is <a href=https://www.jcrete.org/>JCrete®</a> where a selection of the most respected experts in the Java field gather once a year to discuss Java and enjoy the Cretan climate and culture.</p><p>Some other unconferences of note, which are possibly more accessible to those based in the UK, are <a href=https://jalba.scot/>JAlba</a> in Edinburgh and our very own <a href=https://manchesterjavacommunity.org/jmanc/>JManc</a> (that will hopefully making a reappearance in 2022).</p><p><img src=attend.png alt=attend></p><p>Where to start though?</p><p>For me, just turning up and getting a feel for the community is the best starting place.</p><p>First and foremost you&rsquo;ll get the most out of any community you decide to be involved with if you feel welcome and included.</p><p><img src=grow1.png alt=grow1></p><p>This will help you grow.</p><p>If the community is the right fit for you, you&rsquo;ll start to grow a sense of belonging.</p><p>If not, you&rsquo;ll have grown your understanding of what it is your are looking for.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll also grow your experiences, some of which may just be related to stepping outside of your comfort zone.</p><p><img src=receive.png alt=receive></p><p>When you know the community feels right you can start to focus your attention on actively seeking out the content and interactions that are most relevant to you.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll start to be more selective of attending the specific events that interest you and become more aware of people in the community that are of interest.</p><p><img src=grow2.png alt=grow2></p><p>This will help you to grow some more.</p><p>Adopting a more intentional approach to being involved in the community will help you to receive the information you find most relevant and make valuable connections.</p><p><img src=give.png alt=give></p><p>As you become more comfortable within a community you&rsquo;ll gain the confidence to give back.</p><p>Giving back to a community comes in various forms.</p><p>You may simply informally share your knowledge or experience with others in the community.
It may be that you decide to give a talk.
You may offer your ideas and/or time to help the organisers with the event.</p><p>In my opinion all good communities should be open to this kind of involvement and encourage it.
It&rsquo;s the responsibility of organisers to remove barriers and try to make community involvement accessible to all.</p><p><img src=grow3.png alt=grow3></p><p>And you will grow some more.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll gain confidence in yourself as well as the respect of others in the community.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll also gain a sense of achievement when you see your contributions helping the community itself to grow.</p><p><img src=pay-it-forward.png alt=pay-it-forward></p><p>Finally, the most important one for me, you should pay it forward.</p><p>Hopefully when you joined the community you had others who welcomed you and gave their time to provide a positive experience.</p><p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn!</p><p>Engage with newcomers to the community in a way that makes them feel welcome and that they belong.</p><p>Help existing members of the community to follow in your footsteps, whether that&rsquo;s through engaging conversations or creating opportunities for them to help out or give a talk themselves.</p><p><img src=grow4.png alt=grow4></p><p>I&rsquo;ve found that nice side effect of helping others to grow is that you will also.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll also gain the trust and respect of others in the community. This will generally lead to new opportunities both within and outside of the community you are involved with.</p><p><img src=join-communities.png alt=join-communities></p><p>So in summary, my recommendation is to get out there and join communities.</p><p>Take your time to find communities that align with your interests and importantly are inclusive, have good values and make you feel welcome.</p><p><img src=grow-communities.png alt=grow-communities></p><p>Look for opportunities to grow the communities you are a part of, whether that&rsquo;s through spreading the word, volunteering your time or even doing a talk of some kind.</p><p>Most communities welcome and encourage involvement in various ways, sometimes you just need to ask the question &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo; to get started.</p><p><img src=grow-others.png alt=grow-others></p><p>Just being involved in a community as a consumer and maybe a producer will give you lots of opportunity for growth.</p><p>I truly believe though that if you put focus on growing others it&rsquo;s at this point you will grow yourself to another level.</p><p><img src=grow-yourself.png alt=grow-yourself></p><p>So to summarise, through being involed with communities of different kinds and at different levels of engagement you will grow yourself both personally and professionally in a variety of ways.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://nickebbitt.com/blog/2022/01/26/the-story-of-a-java-17-native-memory-leak/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
