Over the course of a few years we’ve standardised the way the JVM is configured out of the box for any new applications that make use of the base image.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2022/01/26/the-story-of-a-java-17-native-memory-leak/>Read more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2021/12/04/grow-yourself-through-communities/>Grow yourself through communities</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2021-12-04 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>I recently spoke at Devoxx UK about how you can grow, both personally and professionally, through being involved in communities. It was in the form of an Ignite talk which was great fun but I realised that there were a few slides that felt a little lightweight compared to others.
Writing the talk up as a blog post will hopefully help me to fill out the lighter parts, as well as maybe make it suitable for a longer length talk at some point in the future.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2021/12/04/grow-yourself-through-communities/>Read more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2021/04/29/debugging-a-jaeger-memory-issue/>Debugging a Jaeger memory issue</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2021-04-29 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>At Auto Trader UK we use Jaeger as the distributed tracing component within our Istio based service mesh to collect & visualise HTTP request traces for the services we run on our Delivery Platform (using GKE).
We have around 400 services running in production and distributed tracing provides a lot of value for us when debugging problems and understanding behaviour across the system.
At a high level, Jaeger consists of the following components:</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2021/04/29/debugging-a-jaeger-memory-issue/>Read more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2019/10/11/discovering-test-doubles/>Discovering Test Doubles</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2019-10-11 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>I wrote most of the content for this post well over a year ago whilst working for Auto Trader.

For the 2nd time, JAlba did not dissappoint!
JAlba is a special kind of conference that follows the open space format. After attending JCrete in 2016, this quickly became my favourite kind of conference, and with JAlba being closer to home it’s an event that would be rude to miss.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2019/06/07/jalba-2019/>Read more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2019/03/01/my-thoughts-on-software-development/>My thoughts on software development</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2019-03-01 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>Around the beginning of this year as I was transitioning between jobs I decided to start writing down my views on software development.
The majority of the ideas, approaches, principles and values in here are things I’ve learned about, experienced or simply formed an opinion on over the last 5 years or so.
This post is basically a dump of those thoughts.
There’s likely nothing new here - I’ve learnt all I know from the amazing people I’ve worked with, consuming many books & videos (both software related and not), attending conferences and simply engaging with the many talented people in the various tech communities I’m involved with such as the Manchester Java Community.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2019/03/01/my-thoughts-on-software-development/>Read more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2018/01/06/a-year-with-the-manchester-java-community/>A year with the Manchester Java Community</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2018-01-06 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>Following JCrete in the summer of 2016 I returned inspired by the people I had met and highly motivated to become more involved in the local tech community.

In October 2016 I did my first (and only so far) public tech talk for the MJC.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2018/01/06/a-year-with-the-manchester-java-community/>Read more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2017/08/21/git-aliases/>Git aliases</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2017-08-21 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>Git aliases are a cool feature. With a little config you can power up your Git command line.
Here a few I have configured that make my day-to-day use of Git much nicer.
status This alias saves me typing a few characters (I’m lazy):
alias.st=git status I can then save my fingers some effort by writing git st to quickly check the status of repo.
log I have the following alias configured that I use in place of the standard git log command:</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2017/08/21/git-aliases/>Read more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2017/07/31/reading-a-file-in-java-8/>Reading a file in Java 8</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2017-07-31 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>I always forget how to read the contents of a file, here’s the simplest way I’ve come across.

Also, if it’s a Stream you’re after then use Files.lines, but don’t forget to close the stream (thanks Tim Yates!).</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2017/07/31/reading-a-file-in-java-8/>Read more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2017/06/26/continuous-unit-testing-with-java-infinitest/>Continuous unit testing with Java & Infinitest</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2017-06-26 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>As my awareness around automated testing, and particularly TDD, has risen over the last few years I’ve been keeping my ear to the ground for new ideas and techniques I can experiment with.

The talk provided a great live demo of TDD exploring a fairly simple use-case but showing how natural the TDD process can be.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2017/06/26/continuous-unit-testing-with-java-infinitest/>Read more →</a></div></article><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/page/2/ class="button next"><span class=button__text>Older posts</span>
