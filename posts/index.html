Whoever comes are the right people!
Thanks to all who attended, itâ€™s down to each and every one of you that JManc Unconference 2024 was a success!
See you next year! ðŸ˜€
intro In January this year we decided to test the interest of the Manchester Java Community on whether they were up for another edition of the JManc Unconference.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2024/07/20/jmanc-2024/>Read more â†’</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2024/01/11/structure-logging-in-java/>Structure logging in Java</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2024-01-11 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>Key takeaways:

Over the course of a few years weâ€™ve standardised the way the JVM is configured out of the box for any new applications that make use of the base image.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2022/01/26/the-story-of-a-java-17-native-memory-leak/>Read more â†’</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2021/12/04/grow-yourself-through-communities/>Grow yourself through communities</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2021-12-04 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>I recently spoke at Devoxx UK about how you can grow, both personally and professionally, through being involved in communities. It was in the form of an Ignite talk which was great fun but I realised that there were a few slides that felt a little lightweight compared to others.
Writing the talk up as a blog post will hopefully help me to fill out the lighter parts, as well as maybe make it suitable for a longer length talk at some point in the future.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2021/12/04/grow-yourself-through-communities/>Read more â†’</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2021/04/29/debugging-a-jaeger-memory-issue/>Debugging a Jaeger memory issue</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2021-04-29 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>At Auto Trader UK we use Jaeger as the distributed tracing component within our Istio based service mesh to collect & visualise HTTP request traces for the services we run on our Delivery Platform (using GKE).
We have around 400 services running in production and distributed tracing provides a lot of value for us when debugging problems and understanding behaviour across the system.
At a high level, Jaeger consists of the following components:</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2021/04/29/debugging-a-jaeger-memory-issue/>Read more â†’</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2019/10/11/discovering-test-doubles/>Discovering Test Doubles</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2019-10-11 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>I wrote most of the content for this post well over a year ago whilst working for Auto Trader. When I joined the company I landed in a team that was pretty unique compared to any Iâ€™d worked in before. The focus on quality and technical excellence was very high, there was a real focus on collaboration and I really started to get a feel for what it might be like in an XP team.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2019/10/11/discovering-test-doubles/>Read more â†’</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2019/06/07/jalba-2019/>JAlba 2019</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2019-06-07 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>On the morning of 23rd May 2019 a group of Java enthusiasts from around the world converged on the historic Scottish city of Edinburgh for the 2nd edition of JAlba Unconference.
For the 2nd time, JAlba did not dissappoint!
JAlba is a special kind of conference that follows the open space format. After attending JCrete in 2016, this quickly became my favourite kind of conference, and with JAlba being closer to home itâ€™s an event that would be rude to miss.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2019/06/07/jalba-2019/>Read more â†’</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2019/03/01/my-thoughts-on-software-development/>My thoughts on software development</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2019-03-01 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>Around the beginning of this year as I was transitioning between jobs I decided to start writing down my views on software development.
The majority of the ideas, approaches, principles and values in here are things Iâ€™ve learned about, experienced or simply formed an opinion on over the last 5 years or so.
This post is basically a dump of those thoughts.
Thereâ€™s likely nothing new here - Iâ€™ve learnt all I know from the amazing people Iâ€™ve worked with, consuming many books & videos (both software related and not), attending conferences and simply engaging with the many talented people in the various tech communities Iâ€™m involved with such as the Manchester Java Community.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2019/03/01/my-thoughts-on-software-development/>Read more â†’</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2018/01/06/a-year-with-the-manchester-java-community/>A year with the Manchester Java Community</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2018-01-06 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>Following JCrete in the summer of 2016 I returned inspired by the people I had met and highly motivated to become more involved in the local tech community. This led me to attend more events such as XP Manchester and the Manchester Java Community (MJC). I also offered to speak at a future MJC event if they would be open to it.
In October 2016 I did my first (and only so far) public tech talk for the MJC.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2018/01/06/a-year-with-the-manchester-java-community/>Read more â†’</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.nickebbitt.com/blog/2017/08/21/git-aliases/>Git aliases</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2017-08-21 ::</time></div><div class=post-content>Git aliases are a cool feature. With a little config you can power up your Git command line.
Here a few I have configured that make my day-to-day use of Git much nicer.
status This alias saves me typing a few characters (Iâ€™m lazy):
alias.st=git status I can then save my fingers some effort by writing git st to quickly check the status of repo.
log I have the following alias configured that I use in place of the standard git log command:</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/blog/2017/08/21/git-aliases/>Read more â†’</a></div></article><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/posts/page/2/ class="button next"><span class=button__text>Older posts</span>
